# The Guided First Run - the game's opening, taught by playing
# New Game streams the wish-granting-power premise, then leads the

# SCRIPTED event sequence: a dialogue encounter tuned winnable by words
# (the first monster is RECRUITED, not generated), one battle beside the
# new companion (wary - it fights on its own terms), then a forced exit.
# Python scripts the rolls; the LLM does everything else.
