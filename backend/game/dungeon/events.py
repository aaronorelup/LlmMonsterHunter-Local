# Dungeon Events - Random Event Assignment for Paths
# Events are chosen randomly in Python (NOT by the LLM) when paths are
# generated, stored in dungeon state, and hidden from the player until
# they choose the path.
# The constants below are the no-run defaults; an active expedition's
# danger word (dungeon/run_context.py) overrides the marked knobs.

# Every event a path can hold, with its weight. Exploring is the bread
# and butter of a run - encounters punctuate it. Add new events here as
# they are built (future: 'trap', ...)

    'location_explore': 0.55,  # arrive, look around, decide what to do
    'monster_dialogue': 0.18,  # a monster greets the party with a question
    'monster_battle': 0.18,  # hostile monsters attack on arrival
    'treasure': 0.09,  # a hidden item waits to be discovered
}

# (they are not immediately hostile - talk, ambush, or sneak past them)

# use the LAST ones. Small local LLMs repeat themselves early; asking for
# extra and taking the later entries plays to their strengths
