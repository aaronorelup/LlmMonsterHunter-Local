# Chat Manager - Home-Base Conversations with Following Monsters
# Owns who can be talked to, the persistent per-monster thread (messages,
# rolling summaries, extraction watermark), and the composition of chat
# context blocks for prompts. The LLM calls themselves live in
# generator.py; the workflow lives in registered_workflows.py.
